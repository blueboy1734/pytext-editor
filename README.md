# PyText Editor #
A text editor developed in Python using Tkinter for the GUI implementation.

# Files #
* `main.py` - Contains the code.
* `icon.png` - The icon I created for the program.
* `PyText Editor Icon.odg` - The icon in its original file format (requires LibreOffice Draw or other programs that read .odg files).

# Issues #
Some issues are present, including:
* The UI not properly resizing.
* The "Undo Last Change" not properly working.

# Development History #
I originally made this program around May 2022 to become familiar with Python and the Tkinter interface. After trying out beginner programming tools, like Code.org and Scratch, I wanted to step out of my comfort zone and develop a program using tools developers use in the real world, so I picked Python and the Tkinter interface. While creating this program, I read online manuals and StackOverflow to figure out which code would work best with the tasks I had in mind and troubleshoot issues I encountered, like the program not reading the file or some buttons not being shown. I also wanted to make an icon for this program as if I were publishing it, so I used LibreOffice Draw to design it. The publishment of this program is for those interested in the personal projects I developed over the years.
